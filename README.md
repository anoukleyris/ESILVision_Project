# ESILVision_Project

  The ESILVision project emerges as a crucial evolution for the smooth functioning of ESILV. As part of a large-scale initiative, ESILV is occasionally affected by administrative issues that significantly impact the educational progress of students. Faced with these challenges, the creation of a new website, more reliable and attentive to the concerns of administrative staff and students, has proven to be indispensable. Designed and deployed on Visual Studio Code with the integrationof Streamlit, this portal offers a comprehensive array of features.

  Key functionalities include the complete visualization of the academic profile of each student, a messaging system fostering communication between administration and students, as well as total autonomy for the administration in managing students, teachers, and courses.
